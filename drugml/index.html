    With remarkable successes of machine learning in a variety of application areas, we are witnessing an increasing interest in applications of machine learning to drug discovery and development.   
</p>
<p>
    In this tutorial, we cover key advancements in machine learning over the last few years, with an emphasis on fundamentally new opportunities in drug development enabled by these advancements. We are interested in why and how these advances can help drug-related tasks. We elaborate uses of machine learning in drug development through six key tasks: (a) synthesis prediction and de novo drug design, (b) molecular property prediction, (c) virtual drug screening and drug-target interactions, (d) clinical trial recruitment, (e) drug repurposing, (f) adverse drug effects and polypharmacy. 
</p>
<p>
    We discuss theoretical foundations behind methods for these key drug-related tasks, illustrate various approaches based on different formulations, and summarize representative applications. We cover generative models, reinforcement learning, as well as very recent advancements in deep representation learning and embeddings. In doing so, we present a toolbox of AI algorithms for end-to-end drug development.

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Drug discovery and development is a long and expensive process. It usually starts with experimental discovery of molecules and targets (i.e., <em>de novo</em> drug design), and validation of discoveries with <em>in vitro</em> experiments on cell lines, organoids, and animals before moving to clinical testing. The entire process from discovery to the regulatory approval of a new drug can take as much as 12 years and cost upwards of US$2.8 billion. Furthermore, huge uncertainty (1:5000 success rate) is associated with each drug development stage.</p>

<p>Machine learning methods have emerged as a promising tool to address these challenges and accelerate drug development. In the tutorial, we cover the following key drug-related tasks:</p>

<ol type="a">
  <li><b>Synthesis prediction and <i>de novo</i> drug design</b> (i.e., designing an entirely new molecule from scratch) aims to generate chemically correct structures to assist in complex molecule synthesis.</li>
  <li><b>Molecular property prediction</b> aims to identify therapeutic effects of molecules by predicting properties, such as potency, bioactivity, and toxicity, from the molecular data.</li>
  <li><b>Virtual drug screening and drug target identification</b> aim to predict how drugs affect the human body by binding to target proteins and affecting their downstream activity.</li>
  <li><b>Clinical trial recruitment</b> aims to identify the right doctors to help conduct the trials as well as find qualified patients to participate the trials.</li>
  <li><b>Drug repurposing</b> seeks to find new uses for known drugs as well as for novel molecules through the use of drug chemical, target and side effect similarity between drugs and diseases.</li>
  <li><b>Adverse drug effects, polypharmacy, and drug-food interaction prediction</b> aims to predict mechanisms causing adverse drug effects, suggest alternative drug members for the intended pharmacological effects without negative health effects, and predict the effects of food constituents on interacting drugs.</li>
</ol>

<p>We then discuss key classes of methods for tackling these drug-related tasks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Generative models.</strong> We focus on variational autoencoders (VAE) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) that are well suited for de novo molecule design. They take as input line or graph-based compound representations with known therapeutic properties, encode the compounds into latent spaces, and then decode them into new drug samples.</li>
  <li><strong>Reinforcement learning.</strong> We mainly talk about policy gradient methods, state-of-the-art methods for molecule generation that can incorporate domain-specific knowledge about molecule synthesis.</li>
  <li><strong>Deep representation learning.</strong> We present major neural architectures for learning representations of drug-related data. These methods are relevant because they achieve state-of-the-art performance on drug-related tasks. For example, the methods were used to automatically learn drug fingerprints, learn drug-protein binding affinity, and recruit patients into clinical trials. Further, graph embedding methods are used to study drug combinations and predict drug effects as they spread throughout biological networks beyond the molecules to which they directly bind.</li>
</ul>
